 https://demowebshop.tricentis.com/


1) I Contributed to a project focused on improving the quality and efficiency 
of testing for an e commerce website.
2) We designed and implemented an automation framework called Page 
Object Model (POM) using Java, Selenium WebDriver and TestNG.
3) Collaboration, with QA and development teams allowed us to identify test 
scenarios covering areas like user registration, product search, cart 
management and checkout processes.
4) Our team developed test scripts that enabled data driven testing and 
ensured compatibility across browsers.
5) Detailed reports were generated using TestNG to provide information 
about the test execution.
6) We maintained scripts for generating test data. Scheduled test suite runs.
& Through our efforts we achieved enhancements, in both testing efficiency 
and product quality while also reducing testing workload
